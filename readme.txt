== Installation ==

1. Go to **Plugins > Add New** in your WordPress admin
2. Search for "WPZOOM Addons for Elementor"
3. Click **Install Now** and then **Activate**

**Manual Installation:**

1. Upload the `wpzoom-elementor-addons` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu

**Usage:**

Once activated, edit any page with Elementor and click the **WPZOOM Library** button to browse and import templates or sections.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What to do if a template is not loading? =

Try importing again - this works in most cases. Templates with many images may take longer to import because Elementor uploads all images to the Media Library and generates thumbnails for each registered image size.


= Who should use this plugin? =

Anyone using Elementor who wants access to professionally designed templates, sections, and widgets to build pages faster.

= What are the requirements? =

You only need the **Elementor** plugin installed and activated.

= What themes does it work with? =

The plugin works with any WordPress theme. Templates are optimized for WPZOOM themes but can be customized for any theme.

= Will it slow down my website? =

No. The plugin only adds templates and widgets to the Elementor editor. It does not affect your website's frontend performance.
